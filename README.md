# FAFI
This application was created for Fun @ Firstfuel India sports council.

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.


Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew
    npm start

[Npm][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.


## Building for production

To optimize the FAFI application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

###Executing the WAR file without an application server
The first WAR file generated in the previous step is such a WAR, so you can run it in “production” mode by typing (on Mac OS X or Linux):

./fafi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war

If you are on Windows, use:

java -jar fafi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test

UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [src/test/javascript/e2e](src/test/javascript/e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`./gradlew bootRun`) and running the tests (`npm run e2e`) in a second one.

## Using Docker

A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootRepackage -Pprod buildDocker

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
